However, there are actually ways to achieve making any amount of money every month without doing anything. I will introduce one of the ways to do that which is dividend investing."

    "In the U.S. stock market, many healthy and mature companies pay cash to its shareholders as dividend every certain period. Periods can be monthly, quarterly or every 6 months or every year. The good thing is investors who own shares of those companies don't have to do anything to collect periodic dividends. Cash payments just deposit directly to shareholders' accounts. All shareholders have to do to collect dividends is just buy and hold the shares of the company which pay out dividends. As shareholders, we can do whatever we want with the dividends. we can pay monthly expenses like phone bills or rents, go shopping to buy whatever we want or buy more shares to collect more dividends later."

The most important question is find out good companies to buy, and when we should buy them. Should we buy them when their prices are really expensive? No. We should buy them when their shares are traded at discount. How do we determine when prices are cheap? That's what we are going to find out in this notebook."
